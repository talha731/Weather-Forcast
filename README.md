# Weather-Forcast
This repo is about creating a weather forecast dashboard for the user. This challange is about a webpage that uses Javascript, HTML and CSS to generate a weather forecast dashboard which would help the user organize their day from it if they are traveling or even in their own city because it can help them plan their day according to the weather. It uses the information added to the input bar and saves it on the localstorage of the browser to make sure the the input does not disapper also uses a clear history button to make clear the local storage. The html code is given in the starter code to make the page work but the real magic is done with the help of javascript, jquery and API.

My motivation for this project is to make sure the I have learned the stuff taugh in the lessons. To make this project a stepping stone on my journy to a frontend developer. I built this because I wanted to test what the knowledge that I gained from the bootcamp and apply it to a real world example.

It solves problems of checking the weather of anywhere in the world.

I learned how to use different functions, methods etc of Javascript,jquery and APIs
